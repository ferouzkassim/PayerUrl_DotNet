# PayerUrl_DotNet
PayerUrl payment intergration with c# and asp.net
so this is part of my private Repos but just thought it could share since the only payerUrl documentation is in PHP
all you need is to 

##
builder.Services.PayerUrl();// add this as a dependancy in your middleware

##
the file ModelDtos

just maps the modles to the expected models at payer url's endpoint 

the result will be a string formatted as a link 

if you are using mvc RazorViews you can embed this in a partial view or if you hae a fornt end Framework You can redirect your URL to this incomming string 

Feel Free to Star this if it at any point helped you
